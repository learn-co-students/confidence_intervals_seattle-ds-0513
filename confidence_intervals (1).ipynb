Rather, what our correspondent means is that, if we were to conduct the same measuring experiment many times, constructing intervals in the same way, we should expect 90% of those intervals to contain the true population mean.\n",

    "Naturally, the confidence interval will be centered on our sample mean. To construct the endpoints we step out from the center with a step size equal to the standard error, $\\large\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. The number of steps we take is determined by which level of confidence we want attached to our interval: In particular, we take $z$-many steps, where $z$ is the (two-tailed) z-score that corresponds to our chosen level of confidence.\n",
